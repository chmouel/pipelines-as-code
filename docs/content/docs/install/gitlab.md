# GitLab and Pipelines-as-Code: Better Together!

Want to use Pipelines-as-Code with GitLab? Awesome! You can totally hook them up using a webhook.

First things first, make sure you've got Pipelines-as-Code installed on your Kubernetes cluster. If you haven't already, jump over to the [installation guide](/docs/install/installation) and get that sorted.

## Grab a GitLab Personal Access Token

You'll need a personal access token in GitLab to make this work. Think of it as a password just for Pipelines-as-Code to talk to GitLab.

*  Head over to this GitLab page to create one:

   <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html>

   **Important Note:**  When you're creating this token, you might be tempted to scope it just to your project.  However, for things to run smoothly ‚Äì especially when dealing with Merge Requests from forked repos ‚Äì the token needs broader `api` access. If you use a project-scoped token, it might stumble when trying to update the Merge Request status directly. Don't worry, even if it can't update the MR directly, Pipelines-as-Code is smart enough to still show you the pipeline status as a comment on your Merge Request. Pretty neat, huh?

## Setting up your Repository and Webhook: Two Ways to Roll

You've got a couple of options to get your `Repository` set up and the webhook configured. Pick whichever way feels more your style!

### Option 1: The Speedy `tkn pac` Tool Method

* If you're a command-line ninja, the [`tkn pac create repo`](/docs/guide/cli) command is your friend. It'll whip up a `Repository` custom resource (CR) and configure the webhook for you in a flash.

  For this to work its magic, you'll need that personal access token we talked about, but this time it needs to have `admin:repo_hook` scope.  `tkn pac` uses this token to set up the webhook and tucks it away securely in your cluster as a secret. Pipelines-as-Code controller will then use this secret to access your repository.  Think of it as giving Pipelines-as-Code the keys to the GitLab kingdom, but only for the parts it needs!

  Here‚Äôs a sneak peek at how the `tkn pac create repo` command looks in action:

  ```shell script
  $ tkn pac create repo

  ? Enter the Git repository url (default: https://gitlab.com/repositories/project):
  ? Please enter the namespace where the pipeline should run (default: project-pipelines):
  ! Namespace project-pipelines is not found
  ? Would you like me to create the namespace project-pipelines? Yes
  ‚úì Repository repositories-project has been created in project-pipelines namespace
  ‚úì Setting up GitLab Webhook for Repository https://gitlab.com/repositories/project
  ? Please enter the project ID for the repository you want to be configured,
    project ID refers to an unique ID (e.g. 34405323) shown at the top of your GitLab project : 17103
  üëÄ I have detected a controller url: https://pipelines-as-code-controller-openshift-pipelines.apps.awscl2.aws.ospqa.com
  ? Do you want me to use it? Yes
  ? Please enter the secret to configure the webhook for payload validation (default: lFjHIEcaGFlF):  lFjHIEcaGFlF
  ‚Ñπ Ô∏èYou now need to create a GitLab personal access token with `api` scope
  ‚Ñπ Ô∏èGo to this URL to generate one https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens, see https://is.gd/rOEo9B for documentation
  ? Please enter the GitLab access token:  **************************
  ? Please enter your GitLab API URL:  https://gitlab.com
  ‚úì Webhook has been created on your repository
  üîë Webhook Secret repositories-project has been created in the project-pipelines namespace.
  üîë Repository CR repositories-project has been updated with webhook secret in the project-pipelines namespace
  ‚Ñπ Directory .tekton has been created.
  ‚úì A basic template has been created in /home/Go/src/gitlab.com/repositories/project/.tekton/pipelinerun.yaml, feel free to customize it.
  ‚Ñπ You can test your pipeline by pushing the generated template to your git repository
  ```

### Option 2: The Manual, Hands-On Approach

* Prefer doing things yourself? No problem! You can manually set up the webhook in GitLab and then create the `Repository` CR.

  *  In your GitLab project, look for **Settings** in the left sidebar, and then click on **Webhooks**.

  *  You'll need the public URL of your Pipelines-as-Code controller. If you're on OpenShift, you can grab it with this command:

    ```shell
    echo https://$(oc get route -n pipelines-as-code pipelines-as-code-controller -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
    ```

  *  Next, you need to create a secret for webhook validation. You can either come up with your own super-secret string or generate a random one using this command:

    ```shell
    head -c 30 /dev/random | base64
    ```

  *  Take a peek at [this screenshot](/images/gitlab-add-webhook.png) for a visual guide on setting up the webhook.

    Make sure to select these individual events to trigger your pipelines:

    * Merge request Events
    * Push Events
    * Comments
    * Tag push events

  *  Finally, hit **Add webhook**. You're halfway there!

*  Now, let's create that [`Repository CRD`](/docs/guide/repositorycrd).  This CR will need to know about two Kubernetes Secrets: one for your Personal Access Token and another for the webhook secret you just set in GitLab. This is how Pipelines-as-Code knows it's talking to the right GitLab repo and that the webhook calls are legit.

*  Time to create those secrets in the namespace where you plan to run your CI pipelines (let's call it `target-namespace`):

  ```shell
  kubectl -n target-namespace create secret generic gitlab-webhook-config \
    --from-literal provider.token="YOUR_GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    --from-literal webhook.secret="YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
  ```
  **Important:** Replace `YOUR_GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with the actual values you generated earlier.

*  Lastly, create the `Repository` CR, referencing the secret you just made. Here‚Äôs an example:

  ```yaml
  ---
  apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
  kind: Repository
  metadata:
    name: my-repo
    namespace: target-namespace
  spec:
    url: "https://gitlab.com/group/project"
    git_provider:
      # url: "https://gitlab.example.com/ # If you're using a private GitLab instance, uncomment and set this
      secret:
        name: "gitlab-webhook-config"
        # key: "provider.token" # If your secret key is different, uncomment and set this
      webhook_secret:
        name: "gitlab-webhook-config"
        # key: "webhook.secret" # If your secret key is different, uncomment and set this
  ```

## Quick Notes to Keep in Mind

*  Using a private GitLab instance? Pipelines-as-Code isn't automatically going to figure that out *just yet*. You'll need to tell it the API URL explicitly by setting `git_provider.url` in your `Repository` spec.

*  Want to override the default GitLab API URL for any reason?  Just pop it into that `git_provider.url` field. Easy peasy.

*  Heads up! The `git_provider.secret` has to live in the *same* namespace as your `Repository` CR. Pipelines-as-Code always assumes they're neighbors.

## Need to Add a Webhook Secret Later?

*  If you've got an existing `Repository` and you need to add a webhook secret (maybe it got deleted, or you're setting up a new webhook in GitLab), `tkn pac webhook add` to the rescue!  This command adds the webhook to your GitLab project settings and updates the `webhook.secret` in your existing `Secret` object ‚Äì all without messing with your `Repository` CR.

  Here‚Äôs how it looks:

  ```shell script
  $ tkn pac webhook add -n project-pipelines

  ‚úì Setting up GitLab Webhook for Repository https://gitlab.com/repositories/project
  ? Please enter the project ID for the repository you want to be configured,
    project ID refers to an unique ID (e.g. 34405323) shown at the top of your GitLab project : 17103
  üëÄ I have detected a controller url: https://pipelines-as-code-controller-openshift-pipelines.apps.awscl2.aws.ospqa.com
  ? Do you want me to use it? Yes
  ? Please enter the secret to configure the webhook for payload validation (default: TXArbGNDHTXU):  TXArbGNDHTXU
  ‚úì Webhook has been created on your repository
  üîë Secret repositories-project has been updated with webhook secret in the project-pipelines namespace.
  ```

**Remember:** If your `Repository` isn't in the `default` namespace, use `tkn pac webhook add [-n namespace]`. In the example above, the `Repository` is in `project-pipelines`, so we use `-n project-pipelines`.

## Time for a Token Refresh?

Got a new personal access token?  No sweat, here's how to update it.

### Option 1: `tkn pac webhook update-token` to the Rescue!

*  The [`tkn pac webhook update-token`](/docs/guide/cli) command is your quick and easy way to swap out the old token for the new one in your `Repository` CR.

  Like this:

  ```shell script
  $ tkn pac webhook update-token -n repo-pipelines

  ? Please enter your personal access token:  **************************
  üîë Secret repositories-project has been updated with new personal access token in the project-pipelines namespace.
  ```

**Again:** If your `Repository` is in a namespace other than `default`, don't forget to use `tkn pac webhook add [-n namespace]`.

### Option 2:  YAML Edit or `kubectl patch` ‚Äì The Manual Update

If you prefer a more hands-on approach, or just like editing YAML directly, you can update the token that way too.

First, you'll need to find the name of the secret in your `Repository` CR.  It's usually under `spec.git_provider.secret.name`.

  ```yaml
  spec:
    git_provider:
      # url: "https://gitlab.example.com/ # Set this if you are using a private GitLab instance
      secret:
        name: "gitlab-webhook-config"
  ```

Then, replace `$NEW_TOKEN` and `$target_namespace` in the command below with your new token and the namespace where your secret lives:

```shell
kubectl -n $target_namespace patch secret gitlab-webhook-config -p "{\"data\": {\"provider.token\": \"$(echo -n $NEW_TOKEN|base64 -w0)\"}}"
```

And that's it! You're all set to use Pipelines-as-Code with GitLab webhooks. Happy pipelining! üéâ
