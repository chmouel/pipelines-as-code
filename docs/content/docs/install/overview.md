# Getting Pipelines-as-Code Installed

Good news! You can install Pipelines-as-Code with different methods depending on your Git platform (think GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.).

For the best experience though, we suggest using a [GitHub Application](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps). It's usually the easiest way to get started.

# Setting up Pipelines-as-Code

Okay, let's get you up and running with Pipelines-as-Code! Here's the lowdown:

*  First things first, you'll need to install Pipelines-as-Code:
    *  Using OpenShift Pipelines (version 1.7.x onwards)?  Great! It's probably already installed.
    *  Fancy a manual install?  No sweat, just head over to the [installation guide](/docs/install/installation).
*  After that, you'll want to set up your Git provider (like a GitHub App) so it can talk to Pipelines-as-Code.

## Connecting to Your Git Provider

With Pipelines-as-Code installed, the next step is to connect it to your Git provider.  There are a few ways to do this, so pick the one that works best for you.  If you're unsure, we recommend the GitHub App method â€“ it's generally the easiest.

Here's a rundown of the different setup options for your Git provider:

* [GitHub Application](/docs/install/github_apps).
* [GitHub Webhook](/docs/install/github_webhook)
* [GitLab](/docs/install/gitlab)
* [Bitbucket Server](/docs/install/bitbucket_server)
* [Bitbucket Cloud](/docs/install/bitbucket_cloud)
